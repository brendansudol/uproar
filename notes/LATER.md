LATER:

- type safety of api endpoints (without explicit casting in component fetches)

DONE:

- ⚠ The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy
- Add basic error page at `/auth/auth-code-error`
- Add loading state (spinner?) after clicking on 'sign in' button
